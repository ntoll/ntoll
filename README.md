### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm off social media but [maintain a blog](https://ntoll.org/). Here's [my CV](https://ntoll.org/cv). If you want to collaborate with me, you should [read this first](https://github.com/ntoll/being_together). [Email](mailto:ntoll@ntoll.org) is the best way to get in touch. Everything I say is false... ;-)
